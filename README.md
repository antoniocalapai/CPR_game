# Continuous Perceptual Report (CPR) Game

This repository contains example code and a demonstration video for a **Continuous Perceptual Report (CPR)** task.  
The project is intended for internal use and demonstration purposes and shows how experimental code and analysis scripts can be structured for this type of paradigm.

---

## Contents

- `Experiments/`  
  Example experiment-related files (e.g. configuration, stimuli, or session materials).

- `matlab_scripts/`  
  MATLAB scripts related to running or controlling the CPR task and handling experimental data.

- `python_scripts/`  
  Python scripts for reading, processing, or analysing CPR data and generating plots or summary measures.

- `VideoDemo.mov`  
  A short video demonstration of the CPR task in action.

---

## Requirements

Exact dependencies are documented in the individual scripts, but in general you will need:

- A recent version of **MATLAB** to run the MATLAB scripts  
- **Python 3** with common scientific packages (e.g. `numpy`, `matplotlib`, etc.) to run the Python scripts

These materials are primarily meant as reference and example code rather than a plug-and-play package.

## Usage

This repository is provided for demonstration and internal reference.  
If you intend to use or adapt parts of the code, please review the scripts carefully and adjust them to your own experimental setup and data formats.
