# CPR Game

A lightweight browser-based game prototype built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
The player must react with good timing to keep the character stable and avoid failure.  
The goal of this project is to provide a clean, minimal example of a simple game loop implemented without external libraries.

---

## Features
- Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no frameworks)
- Small, easy-to-read codebase
- Timing-based interaction mechanic
- Pixel-art visual style
- Fully client-side, no installation required

---
## Purpose
This project was created as a small experimental prototype to explore:

- simple timing-based interaction
- minimalist web game design
- rapid prototyping with plain JavaScript

It can serve as a starting point for further gameplay experiments or for building small browser games.
